## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Deliverable 1: Statistical Summary using Multiple Linear Regression

#### **Multiple Linear Regression** is a statiscal tool that uses multiple variables to describe observed variations in the dependent variable. Using this tool, the *R-squared* value shows 71.5% of variations can be explained by the model or formula used. The *p-value* is *5.35e-11*. This means that **vehicle lenght** and **ground clearance** are statistically significant. In other words, these coefficients provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set.

#### The slope of the linear model cannot be considered to be *0* because there is statiscallly significant relationship between the predictor/model and the variables. The slope is equal to *-1.040e+02* While this value is close to *0*, looking at the *t-value* of *-6.559* and a *p-value* of *5.35e-11*, these values supports the idea that there is strong association between the model and the variables.

#### In conclusion, this linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Understanding the statistical analysis used, *R-squared* value is 71.5% , there is a higher *t-value* and a lower *p-value*, therefore the predictor linear model is significant.
